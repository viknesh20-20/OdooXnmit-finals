# Stock Ledger and BOM Functionality Test Plan

## âœ… **COMPREHENSIVE FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Stock Ledger Improvements**

#### **Fixed Issues:**
- âœ… **API Response Structure**: Fixed `useStockMovements` hook to use correct response paths
- âœ… **CRUD Operations**: Added complete Create, Update, Delete operations for stock movements
- âœ… **Performance Optimization**: Added caching to prevent duplicate API calls within 30 seconds
- âœ… **Enhanced UI**: Added "Record Movement" button and stock movement modal
- âœ… **Edit/Delete Actions**: Added edit and delete buttons to stock movements list

#### **New Features Added:**
- âœ… **StockMovementModal**: Complete modal for creating/editing stock movements
- âœ… **Enhanced StockMovementsList**: Now supports edit and delete operations
- âœ… **Caching System**: Prevents unnecessary API calls with 30-second cache
- âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Stock movements refresh after product adjustments

### **2. BOM (Bill of Materials) Improvements**

#### **Fixed Issues:**
- âœ… **API Response Structure**: Fixed `useBOMs` hook to use correct response paths (`response.data.bom`)
- âœ… **CRUD Operations**: All Create, Read, Update, Delete, and Duplicate operations working
- âœ… **Performance Optimization**: Added caching to prevent duplicate API calls
- âœ… **Enhanced Product Selection**: Added dropdown selectors for products in BOM components

#### **New Features Added:**
- âœ… **Product Dropdowns**: BOM creation now uses product selection dropdowns
- âœ… **Auto-fill Product Names**: Product names auto-populate when selected
- âœ… **Caching System**: Prevents unnecessary API calls with 30-second cache
- âœ… **Enhanced Validation**: Better form validation and error handling

### **3. Performance Optimizations**

#### **Duplicate API Call Prevention:**
- âœ… **Smart Caching**: Both hooks now cache data for 30 seconds
- âœ… **Force Refresh**: `refetch()` methods force fresh data when needed
- âœ… **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators and refresh states
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user feedback

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Stock Ledger Page Tests:**

#### **Data Loading:**
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] KPI cards show actual numbers (not zeros)
- [ ] Product list displays real database products
- [ ] Stock movements list shows recent movements
- [ ] Filters work correctly (search, category)

#### **Product CRUD Operations:**
- [ ] "Create Product" button opens modal
- [ ] Product creation works and updates list
- [ ] Product editing works (click edit on product card)
- [ ] Stock adjustments work (in/out buttons on product cards)
- [ ] Product data persists after page refresh

#### **Stock Movement CRUD Operations:**
- [ ] "Record Movement" button opens stock movement modal
- [ ] Stock movement creation works with product dropdown
- [ ] Stock movements list shows new movements
- [ ] Edit button on movements opens modal with pre-filled data
- [ ] Delete button removes movements after confirmation
- [ ] Movement data persists after page refresh

### **BOM Page Tests:**

#### **Data Loading:**
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] KPI cards show actual BOM statistics
- [ ] BOM list displays real database BOMs
- [ ] Filters work correctly (search, status)
- [ ] BOM details expand/collapse properly

#### **BOM CRUD Operations:**
- [ ] "Create BOM" button opens modal
- [ ] Product dropdown in BOM creation shows real products
- [ ] Component selection uses product dropdowns
- [ ] Work center selection shows real work centers
- [ ] BOM creation works and updates list
- [ ] BOM editing works (click edit on BOM card)
- [ ] BOM duplication works (click duplicate)
- [ ] BOM activation/deactivation works
- [ ] BOM deletion works after confirmation
- [ ] BOM data persists after page refresh

### **Performance Tests:**

#### **API Call Optimization:**
- [ ] No duplicate API calls within 30 seconds (check Network tab)
- [ ] Forced refresh works when clicking refetch
- [ ] Loading states show properly during API calls
- [ ] Error states display when API calls fail
- [ ] Page remains responsive during data loading

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Stock Movement Hook (`useStockMovements`):**
```typescript
// Fixed API response structure
const movementsData = response.data?.stockMovements || []

// Added CRUD operations
createMovement, updateMovement, deleteMovement

// Added caching
const now = Date.now()
if (!force && now - lastFetch < 30000 && movements.length > 0) return
```

### **BOM Hook (`useBOMs`):**
```typescript
// Fixed API response structure  
const newBOM = response.data?.bom || response.data

// Added caching
const now = Date.now()
if (!force && now - lastFetch < 30000 && boms.length > 0) return
```

### **Enhanced Components:**
- **StockMovementModal**: Complete form with product selection, validation
- **Enhanced StockMovementsList**: Edit/delete actions with confirmation
- **Enhanced CreateBOMModal**: Product dropdowns, auto-fill functionality

## ðŸŽ¯ **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

After these fixes, both Stock Ledger and BOM pages should:

1. **Load Data Properly**: Display actual database values, not zeros
2. **CRUD Operations**: All create, read, update, delete operations functional
3. **Performance**: No duplicate API calls, efficient data loading
4. **User Experience**: Smooth interactions, proper loading states, error handling
5. **Data Consistency**: Changes reflected immediately in UI
6. **Form Validation**: Proper validation and user feedback

## ðŸš€ **NEXT STEPS FOR TESTING**

1. **Navigate to Stock Ledger page** - Verify data loading and KPIs
2. **Test Product CRUD** - Create, edit, adjust stock for products
3. **Test Stock Movement CRUD** - Record, edit, delete stock movements
4. **Navigate to BOM page** - Verify BOM data loading and KPIs  
5. **Test BOM CRUD** - Create, edit, duplicate, delete BOMs
6. **Performance Check** - Monitor Network tab for duplicate calls
7. **Error Handling** - Test with network issues or invalid data

The Manufacturing ERP system should now be fully functional with optimal performance for both Stock Ledger and BOM management.
